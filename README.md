# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the analysis is to clean and organize data to better understand the school district summary, school summary, average math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and type. The data is made up of fifteen High Schools within two districts. These data points can give the stakeholders an insight into how students are performing on reading and math scores. The analysis further breaks down the data to show differences in school districts and the variations in overall passing scores based on total budgets. This analysis can help stakeholders build better budget plans and uncover opportunities to help schools improve their student scores. In the final analysis, Thomas High School ninth graders were removed from the analysis because some of the data had appeared to be altered. The purpose of this summary will illustrate how the change affected the reports which were created.
